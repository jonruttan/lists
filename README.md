#Dynamic Lists in C
> Dynamic vector based lists/stacks in C.
 *****

There is no Makefile. To add to your project, `#include "lists.h"` in your source file, and add *`lists.c`* to your project's files to compile.

There is a test/example called *`lists_test.c`*, to compile:
```bash
> cc lists_test.c lists.c -o lists_test
```
